#Data Science Project: Exploratory Analysis of 1990s Movies ðŸŽ¬

This project was part of the DataCamp Data Science course, where the objective was to perform an exploratory analysis on a dataset of 1990s movies. The analysis aimed to answer two key questions:

What is the most common duration of movies from the 1990s?
How many short action movies (with a runtime of less than 90 minutes) from the 1990s are present in the dataset?
The project involved using Python to clean, explore, and visualize the data, providing insights into the trends of movie durations during that decade.
